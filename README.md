Titanic Survival Prediction

A beginner-friendly data analysis project on the famous Titanic dataset. This project covers:
	â€¢	Data cleaning & preprocessing
	â€¢	Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations
	â€¢	Building a simple machine learning model (Logistic Regression)
	â€¢	Evaluating the modelâ€™s accuracy


ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset contains information about Titanic passengers, such as:
	â€¢	Name, Age, Sex
	â€¢	Passenger class (Pclass)
	â€¢	Number of siblings/spouses (SibSp)
	â€¢	Number of parents/children (Parch)
	â€¢	Ticket, Fare, Cabin, and Embarkation port
	â€¢	Survival status (0 = Did not survive, 1 = Survived)

Dataset source: Kaggle Titanic Dataset


 Project Workflow
	1.	Data Cleaning
	â€¢	Handled missing values (Age, Cabin, Embarked).
	â€¢	Converted categorical features (Sex, Embarked) into numeric format.
	2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
	â€¢	Visualized survival rates by gender, age, and passenger class.
	â€¢	Compared survival probabilities across different groups.
	3.	Modeling
	â€¢	Trained a Logistic Regression model.
	â€¢	Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
	4.	Evaluation
	â€¢	Measured model accuracy.
	â€¢	Discussed results and possible improvements.
 

 Tools & Libraries
	â€¢	Python
	â€¢	Pandas
	â€¢	NumPy
	â€¢	Matplotlib / Seaborn
	â€¢	Scikit-learn


ðŸ“ˆ Results
	â€¢	Logistic Regression model achieved a baseline accuracy (you can update with your actual result, e.g., ~78%).
	â€¢	Gender and passenger class were the strongest predictors of survival.


  Future Improvements
	â€¢	Try advanced models like Random Forest or XGBoost.
	â€¢	Perform feature engineering (e.g., family size, title extraction).
	â€¢	Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy.
